# Application Schemas

Why do we need schemas?

- This package contains all the schemas used in the application.
- Schemas are used to validate the data that is being sent to the application.
- Schemas are also used to serialize the data that is being sent to the application.
- Schemas are created using Pydantic.
- The base schema class is defined in the base.py file.
- The schemas are defined in the files in this package.
- The schemas are imported in the routes and services.

## Schemas

- base.py: Contains the base schema class.
- ollama.py: Contains the schema for the Ollama model.
